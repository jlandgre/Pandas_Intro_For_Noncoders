We use the Pandas_Fundamentals.ipynb notebook to familiarize technical people with enough Python and Pandas to use it for simple tasks like subsetting large data sets to enable additional exploration in tools they are already familiar with. The tutorial has proven to be an effective starting point for technical people who may have had a coding course in school but who do not currently do any scripting or coding for their work. The tutorial guides them to install the Anaconda package and use it as a Dashboard for launching Jupyter notebooks. Examples show how Pandas can be used to import a 10K+ row data set, view it, subset it and output the subset as a *.CSV or Excel file for further analysis.

For those who need a refresher on basics of Python, see Python_Jump_Start.ipynb. It is a tutorial on Python lists, dictionaries, how to work with imported libraries etc. --specifically designed for someone whose goal is to jump to using Pandas for data analysis.
